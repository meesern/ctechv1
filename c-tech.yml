#Set the voltage assumed for the monitors circuits.  This could in fact vary between 210 and 250
#if the actual value is know is could be set here.  Use the calibration section to adjust the 
#measured values according to a specific calibration
:voltage:       230

#Calibrate the measurement by setting the :expected value to the value of a corectly
#calibrated source, and set the :reported value to the value reported by the system before
#calibration.  New reported values should then match the calibrated value

#Current clamps should be labeled with the serial number of the monitor board that they are
#connected to ('0501') etc.  - note that these are strings "0501" not octal numbers 0501.
#Map the name of the circuit being monitored to the current clamp serial number.
#Monitors are only saved when this mapping is set
#Curcuit names should be brief and lower case.
